Hi everyone, hope you're doing well. This is not a normal coding post, but rather an update on this blog and where I have been. School has recently started for me, making it harder to post daily or even every 2 days. Besides that, GitHub is blocked on my school Chromebook, so I will not be able to create posts during class time after finishing my homework is done. However, this blog will not be dead anytime soon! I will try to post at least 2 times a week, especially during the weekend. I can't make any promises due to my busy school schedule - but I will try my best. I will also add a slight revision to the layout of this blog during this weekend or next weekend, so stay tuned for that! Happy coding!
