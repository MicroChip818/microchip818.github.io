title: About Me
---
<p>Hi! My name is Ethan, a 15-year-old high school student. I have a burning passion for all things programming, but I have other interests such as chess, swimming, and Roblox. I first learned coding in elementary school when a block coding course was part of my 1st grade curriculum. The concept of putting blocks together to run an automated game program instantly hooked me, leading me to create a few games myself on coding platform Scratch. Although I have taken several breaks from coding over the years, I learned the fundamentals of a few text-based programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and Python. Therefore, I created this blog to share my love for coding, to document my learning experience, and to help others improve at coding. I believe the best way to improve at coding is to practice consistently while learning from mistakes, so this blog will contain various coding exercises alongside projects and learning discoveries.</p>
